# 15b_ofsted_latest.R - Each school's latest Ofsted judgement, whatever the framework
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The panel's Ofsted rating is the last graded inspection before September
# 2024 (R/02c_ofsted_dates.R), which is right for the model years but not
# for saying where a school stands now. Since then Ofsted has inspected
# under two more schemes:
#
#   Sep 2024 - Nov 2025  graded inspections with no overall grade ("Not
#                        judged"), only the four sub-judgements, 1 to 4;
#   Nov 2025 onward      report cards: up to eight evaluation areas on five
#                        points (Exceptional, Strong standard, Expected
#                        standard, Needs attention, Urgent improvement) and
#                        safeguarding met / not met.
#
# Ofsted's monthly management information ("latest inspections", one row a
# school by URN) holds all of these side by side. This downloads the newest
# release, found from GOV.UK's content API, and writes one row a school:
#
#   ofsted_kind     "Report card", "No overall grade", "Graded" or
#                   "Ungraded only"
#   ofsted_latest   the judgement as one line, chosen in that order:
#                   a report card's achievement and curriculum grades; for
#                   an inspection with no overall grade, its quality of
#                   education; otherwise the last graded inspection, with
#                   any later ungraded outcome ("remains Good"); and for a
#                   school last graded before 2019, its latest ungraded
#                   outcome alone
#   ofsted_latest_date, and every report-card area as rc_*
#   oeif_modal      for an inspection with no overall grade, one grade on
#                   the old scale: the most common of its key judgements,
#                   ties going to quality of education (modal_grade())
#
# Output: data/ofsted/ofsted_latest.rds (attribute "as_at": the date the
