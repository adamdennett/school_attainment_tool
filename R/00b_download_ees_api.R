# 00b_download_ees_api.R - Downloads from Explore Education Statistics
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Successor to 00_download_cscp.R.
#
# The Compare School and College Performance service is closing. The 2025/26
# KS4 release states plainly: "CSCP will close soon. From autumn 2026, you will
# be able to use a new service. Data on CSCP will not be updated past the
# 2024/25 academic year." So 00_download_cscp.R can fetch 2021/22-2024/25 and
# nothing after it. That script is kept exactly as it is, because every
# published figure for those four years reproduces from the files it fetched.
#
# From 2025/26 onward the data comes from EES instead, by two routes:
#
#   1. The statistics API, for data sets that have been API-enabled.
#        GET {EES_API_BASE}/data-sets/{dataSetId}/csv
#      Returns the whole data set as a gzipped CSV in EES long format
#      (one row per school x time period x breakdown).
#
#   2. The content API, for data sets that are download-only.
#        GET {EES_CONTENT_BASE}/releases/{releaseId}/files?fileIds={fileId}
#      Returns either a ZIP (data/ + data-guidance/) or a bare CSV, depending
#      on the file. ees_download() sniffs the first bytes and names it right.
#      Note the query-string form: /files/{fileId} answers 200 with an empty
#      body, and /files with no query returns the entire release (129 MB for
#      KS4 2025/26), so neither is what we want.
#
# Discovering ids: open the data set in the EES data catalogue and read
# "API data set ID" for route 1, or the Download link's href for route 2.
#
# Files are NEVER overwritten - pass force = TRUE if a release is revised.
# The KS4 2025/26 figures here are PROVISIONAL; revised land February 2027.
#
# Usage:
#   source("R/00b_download_ees_api.R")
#   ees_update()                      # fetch anything missing
#   ees_download("ks4_institution", force = TRUE)   # refresh one source
#
# Run from project root. Standalone execution runs ees_update().
