# 01b_extract_ees_2526.R - Build the 2025/26 panel year from EES sources
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 01_extract_data.R reads the CSCP performance-table CSVs, which stop at
# 2024/25. This script does the same job for 2025/26 from the EES downloads
# fetched by 00b_download_ees_api.R, and returns a frame with the same column
# names so 02_build_panel.R can bind it on without knowing the difference.
#
# Three things are genuinely different about 2025/26, and all three are
# recorded in the output rather than papered over:
#
#   P8MEA is NA.  Progress 8 is not published for 2024/25 or 2025/26 - those
#   cohorts have no KS2 baseline, because the 2019/20 and 2020/21 primary
#   assessments were cancelled. DfE have said there will be no replacement.
#   PTPRIORLO / PTPRIORHI are NA for the same reason.
#
#   PERCTOT is NA.  Full-year absence for 2025/26 publishes around March 2027.
#   In its place this script builds PERCTOT_2term - overall absence across the
#   autumn and spring terms - for EVERY panel year, from a single file that
#   runs 2016/17 to 2025/26. That makes a consistent five-year absence series
#   possible without touching the full-year PERCTOT the published analysis
#   was fitted on. See ees_absence_2term().
#
#   School attributes are carried forward.  Ofsted rating, admissions policy,
#   school type and coordinates are taken from the school's most recent
#   existing panel row. For Ofsted this is the only defensible option: single
#   headline grades were abolished in September 2024, so no new overall grade
#   exists to read.
#
# Usage:
#   source("R/01b_extract_ees_2526.R")
#   year_2526 <- build_ees_year()
#
# Run from project root.
